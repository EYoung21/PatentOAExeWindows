## Patent Office Action Processor

This project is designed to automate the processing of patent office action documents. It extracts key information from PDF files, retrieves additional data from Google Patents, and organizes the results into a structured format.

### Features

- Extracts text from PDF documents using PyMuPDF and Tesseract OCR
- Parses office action documents to identify key information (application ID, reference number, due date, examiner details, etc.)
- Retrieves additional patent information from Google Patents using web scraping
- Generates summaries of patent documents using OpenAI's GPT model
- Organizes extracted data into CSV files and individual folders for each patent

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7+
- Tesseract OCR installed on your system

### Installation

1. Clone this repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/patent-office-action-processor.git
    cd patent-office-action-processor
    ```

2. Install the required Python packages:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. Set up your environment variables:
   - Create a `.env` file in the project root and add your OpenAI API key:

     ```bash
     OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
     ```

### Usage

1. Place your patent office action PDF files in the `input` directory.
2. Run the main script:

    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```

3. The script will process all PDF files in the `input` directory. Results will be saved in the `output` directory, with a separate folder for each patent and a `data.csv` file containing summary information.

### Building an Executable

If you don't already have an executable, follow these steps:

1. You must have Tesseract OCR downloaded and located in the default folder: `C:\Program Files\Tesseract-OCR\tesseract.exe`. You can find it [here](https://github.com/UB-Mannheim/tesseract/wiki).
2. Run the following command in the terminal:

    ```bash
    pyinstaller oa_processor.spec
    ```

3. Right-click the `dist` folder.
4. Click "Reveal in File Explorer."
5. Open the `dist` folder and copy (Ctrl + C) the executable file.
6. Paste the executable in your desired location and double-click it to run it.

### Output

For each processed patent, you'll find:

- A folder named after the patent application ID
- Inside each folder:
  - `summary.txt`: A summary of the patent generated by GPT
  - `{reference_number}PDF.pdf`: The downloaded PDF from Google Patents

In the main output directory:

- `data.csv`: A CSV file containing key information for all processed patents
